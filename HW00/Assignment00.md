Due at the beginning of the second class of the semester.

Do all of the items below and submit a /text file/ created with thonny, pycharm, vim, or your favorite text editor with the extension =.py= via Moodle. If you run into a problem post to Moodle describing where you ran into trouble, email your instructor or classroom assistant, or ask your question during office hours. If you know the answer to someone's question on Moodle then post a response; you get credit for asking and answering questions on Moodle.

1. Log in to Moodle and post a brief message introducing yourself to the class (e.g. your interests, looking for a study partner, etc.)
2. Read the course syllabus
3. Download Python 3 from python.org and install it on your computer. You can also just install thonny from thonny.org since it has Python built in.
4. In the textbook: Read Chapter 1 and 2
5. In Thonny, create and save a python file that is named, if your name is Harry Houdini for example, =HW0_HarryHoudini.py= and begins with a comment containing your name,class and section, the date and number of the homework assignment.
      Use either a block comment or one-line comment style:
         #+BEGIN_SRC python
         """
         Harry Houdini
         CS100 2017F Section 105
         HW 0, Sept 7, 2017
         """
         #+END_SRC                              
         or
         #+BEGIN_SRC python
         # Harry Houdini
         # CS100 2017F Section 105
         # HW 0, Sept 7, 2017
         #+END_SRC
6. Write three assignment lines, each of which creates a variable (object) with a meaningful name and asssigns it an int value. E.g.:
      #+BEGIN_SRC python
      # Problem 6
      months = 12
      #+END_SRC
7. Write three assignment lines, each of which creates a variable (object) with a meaningful name and assigns it a float value. E.g.:
   #+BEGIN_SRC python
     # Problem 7
     height = 5.8333
   #+END_SRC
8. Write three assignment lines, each of which creates a string variable with a meaningful name. E.g.:
   #+BEGIN_SRC python
     # Problem 8
     notACylon = "Gaius Baltar"
   #+END_SRC
9. Write two assignment statements, one for your first name and one for your last name. Then write two print statements, one that prints out your name like you would write it ("Petyr Baelish") and one that writes it out last name first with a comma ("Baelish, Petyr")
10. Try and print this string with the fewest number of characters in your code: "na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na batman"
11. Do book exercises: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, and 2.2
